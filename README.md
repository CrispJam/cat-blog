## My tenant info

tenantId: `104e3259-6e9b-441a-84b2-e245878c14f8`

apiKey: `950a7a91-9435-4179-b89f-3944c2f128f8`

name: `crispjam`

###  Uploaded images
there seems to be no way to retrieve all uploaded images, so I'll save all of their ids here
```json
  {
    "imageId": "e7ae6fa9-c22e-497e-b659-d20e50af978f",
    "name": "kitten.jpg"
  }
  {
    "imageId": "aefdb73f-034f-4072-a7db-bcc327f7ab56",
    "name": "cathouse.jpg"
  }
```

### Pre-rendered pages not allowed to render images
When using server-side rendering (SSR) or static-site generation (SSG) for pages that use images, there is an issue with displaying them.

The images are retrieved from the backend by the following endpoint
```
https://fullstack.exercise.applifting.cz/images/<img_id>
```
However, this url cannot be passed directly into the `src` of an `<img>` tag because the endpoint requires API_KEY in the request's header for identificating the tenant.

This means it is necessary to first get the image, turn it into a blob, retrieve the url to this blob and then use the url as `src` in the `<img>` tag.

This works fine, when the fetching (calling the API) is done on at client's side. The resulting url looks like this:
```
"blob:http://localhost:3000/228edeea-ceb9-4e4e-bb95-d2d5138d0718"
```

However, when using SSG or SSR, the blob is created within the NextJS backend server and looks like this:
```
blob:nodedata:1fb79cfe-0a3b-4c90-8ff3-3665f2162721
```
When trying to use such a url as `src` in the `<img` tag, the browser throws the following error:
```
Not allowed to load local resource: blob:nodedata:ccd32068-cb28-4c6a-81a8-981bc385b9c2
```
It might be possible to bypass this somehow, but that doesn't seem like a good solution.

For now, the **best possible solution** is probably to not use SSR or SSG for pages that need to fetch images.

Note for **potential backend** implementation:
1. Since API_KEY is not secret anyway, it might be best to expose downloading images without this header requirement. This might be possible like so:
    ```
    https://fullstack.exercise.applifting.cz/<user_name>/images/<img_id>
    ```
2. This way, the endpoint can be used directly in the `<img>` tag without the need to download the image beforehand.

### Where to store the auth_token

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
